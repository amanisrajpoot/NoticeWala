# NoticeWala - Exam Notification Aggregator System

## Project Summary

NoticeWala is a comprehensive, scalable system that automatically discovers, extracts, and delivers exam notifications from various web sources to users via a React Native mobile application. The system addresses the critical problem of students missing important exam deadlines due to scattered information across multiple websites and platforms.

## Core Problem Statement

Students and job seekers face significant challenges in tracking exam notifications because:
- Information is scattered across hundreds of websites (government portals, university sites, coaching centers)
- Critical deadlines are often missed due to lack of timely notifications
- Manual checking of multiple sources is time-consuming and error-prone
- Different sources use varying formats and update schedules
- Language barriers and regional variations complicate discovery

## Solution Overview

NoticeWala provides:
1. **Automated Discovery**: Web crawlers continuously monitor official sources
2. **Intelligent Extraction**: AI-powered parsing of announcements from HTML, PDFs, and images
3. **Structured Data**: Normalized exam information with dates, eligibility, and application details
4. **Personalized Notifications**: Smart filtering and push notifications based on user preferences
5. **Mobile-First Experience**: React Native app for easy access and notifications
